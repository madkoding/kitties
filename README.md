# 🐱 Kitties

**A fleet of autonomous AI agents, each with its own soul and its own desktop.**

Kitties is a Go framework for running **NNN bots** at once. Every kitty has a **soul** (a
personality, yours to shape), a **brain** (the AI provider you pick for it: OpenAI, Anthropic,
Gemini, Ollama, Groq, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Qwen, Mistral, Copilot or any OpenAI-compatible server,
with an API key or a subscription) and a **body**: its own Docker container with a headless
desktop, a browser and the usual tools, so it can work on graphical applications without touching
your machine. Talk to one kitty, or open a group chat and let several work on the same thread.
Everything goes through one **gateway** (an HTTP API with a web page), driven by the `kitties` CLI,
a desktop app and an Android app.

## Features

- **A real desktop per kitty.** Ask it to open a site or fill a form: it works in the background,
  looking at a screenshot after every action, while the chat shows each step. You can watch it live
  and **take control** for what it cannot do alone (a password, a captcha).
- **Autonomy.** Goals on a schedule or triggered by events, limits and a daily budget, retries, a
  backup kitty, delegation between kitties and a journal of everything.
- **Trust and memory.** Notes that persist, thumbs that teach it your standards, action limits and
  approvals that loosen as it earns trust, and notifications to your phone when it needs you.
- **Connectors.** Slack, GitHub, Gmail, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Spotify, Stripe, Home
  Assistant and many more, with sign-in instead of pasted keys where the service allows it.
- **Everywhere.** CLI for Linux, macOS, Windows and Android (Termux); a desktop app; an Android app;
  a server mode with https. Self-updating releases, signed.
- **Go standard library only**, in English, Spanish and Portuguese.

## The kitty's desktop

Lumen (an Openbox fork) with its own shelf (a dock of pinned apps, a player, the weather and a clock), the dark
Numix theme, Lucide icons and Kitties' fonts. [More about it](docs/KITTY-DESKTOP.md).

come from a demo gateway.</sub>

## Quick start

No key and no Docker, with a scripted brain and a drawn desktop:

```sh
go install github.com/madkoding/kitties/cmd/kitties@latest   # or: make build
kitties -demo gateway        # then open http://127.0.0.1:7488 and ask Tom to open https://example.com
```

On a Linux server, one line (release binary, checksum check, `kitties` user, systemd service; see
[INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md#on-a-linux-server-one-line)):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madkoding/kitties/main/scripts/install.sh | sudo sh
```

The real thing (needs Docker or Podman for the desktops):

```sh
kitties init                 # writes kitties.yaml and souls/tom.yaml
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... # or OPENAI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY... (or add a key in Settings)
make image                   # builds the kitty-desktop image
kitties gateway              # creates the kitties, starts them, serves the API and the page
```

Or download the app (it carries its own gateway), from the
[latest release](https://github.com/madkoding/kitties/releases/latest):

Kitties is the fleet counterpart of [motita](https://github.com/madkoding/motita): a kitty can hand
a coding task to a motita gateway and bring the result back, and the desktop app is drawn with
motita's design system.
