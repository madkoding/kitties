# The API

| Method and path                           | What it does                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /v1/health`                          | version, uptime, whether containers are available |
| `GET /v1/providers` · `GET /v1/connectors`| what the kitties can think with and reach      |
| `GET /v1/kitties` · `POST /v1/kitties`    | the fleet; create `{name, provider, soul, connectors, desktop, start}` |
| `POST /v1/kitties/{ref}/start` · `/stop` · `DELETE /v1/kitties/{ref}` | lifecycle, by id or name |
| `POST /v1/kitties/{ref}/exec` `{argv}`    | run a command in its container                 |
| `GET /v1/kitties/{ref}/screenshot`        | a PNG of its display                           |
| `POST /v1/kitties/{ref}/control` `{hold}` | take its display over, or give it back         |
| `POST /v1/kitties/{ref}/input` `{action, args}` | a click, drag, scroll, key or text of the person on it |
| `GET /v1/kitties/{ref}/stream`            | its display live, as motion JPEG (`?fps=1-30`) |
| `GET /v1/kitties/{ref}/rects`             | its display live as what changed on it, like VNC (`?fps=1-30`; `SCREEN`, `UPDATE`, `RECT` lines with JPEG bodies) |
| `GET/PUT /v1/kitties/{ref}/clipboard` `{text}` | its clipboard, both ways                  |
| `POST /v1/scale/{name}` `{replicas}`      | run n replicas of a configured kitty           |
| `GET/POST /v1/chats`                      | threads; create `{title, members: [names]}`    |
| `POST /v1/chats/{id}/members` · `DELETE /v1/chats/{id}/members/{ref}` | who is in the group |
| `POST /v1/chats/{id}/messages` `{text}`   | send a message; returns the kitties' turns (a desktop task goes on in the background: poll the chat) |

| `GET /v1/settings` · `PUT/DELETE /v1/settings/providers/{name}` · `POST …/test` · `PUT/DELETE /v1/settings/connectors/{name}` | the models and the connectors (a connector that signs in needs its sign-in or a key; `?sign_in=1` saves it just before its sign-in); `POST …/connectors/{name}/test` checks its account with a request that only reads |
| `GET /v1/local-token`                     | the token, handed only to a client on the same machine |

| `GET /v1/approvals/rules` · `POST /v1/approvals/rules` `{kitty, connector, action, mode}` · `DELETE /v1/approvals/rules/{id}` | the action limits (ask, never, auto; an empty action is all of the connection's), and taking one away |
| `GET/POST /v1/kitties/{ref}/memory` · `DELETE …/memory/{id}` · `PUT …/memory/profile` · `POST …/memory/distill` | a kitty's notes, its picture of you, and a distillation now |

| `PUT /v1/settings/notify` · `POST /v1/settings/notify/test` · `POST …/notify/digest` | where and when kitties tell you; a test; the daily summary now |
| `GET /v1/chats/{id}/turns/{n}/replay.gif` · `POST …/turns/{n}/help` `{text, secret, enter, save}` | a task as an animated GIF; the person's answer to a kitty that asked for help (a secret is typed on its desktop, not told) |
| `GET /v1/vault` · `PUT/DELETE /v1/vault/{name}` `{value, kitties}` | the secrets a kitty may type: names and who may use them, never values |
| `GET /v1/kitties/{ref}/desktop` · `POST …/backup` · `POST …/update` | its desktop's image and whether a newer one waits, the backup of its cookies, sessions and passwords, and moving it to the newest image |

| `POST /v1/settings/accounts/{kind}/login` · `GET/DELETE /v1/settings/logins/{id}` · `POST …/paste` · `DELETE /v1/settings/accounts/{kind}` | sign a model in with a subscription, follow it, paste the browser's address, sign out |

Every other call needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; `/` and `/v1/health` are open.
